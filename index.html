          <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3> Brief Info </h3>
              <p>Hello, my name is Zheyuan Wu, you can also call me Mike. I am a graduate student from university of Michigan, major in electrical and computer engineering, and my concentration is the embedded systems. 
              </p>
            <h3>Experiences and Skills</h3> 
              <p>
              I have experience in some projects related to some embedded system platform, such as Arduino, raspberry pi and STM32, using C or C++ to program them. For example, I use C to program the NXP microprocessor and realize the autonomous driving simulation in the project of adaptive cruise control,. Besides that, I am also familiar with some hardware part including integrating the sensors, debugging with oscilloscope to make the sensors work well, and soldering. For example, , I use several sensors like ultrasound sensor and Pi camera to realize line following and object detection in the project building autonomous driving electronic car. 
            
              I am also a good team player, enjoy working with different people. In every group project, I am friendly to others and try every opportunity to communication with others. I am also good at time management and multitasking. I am able to handle the project even if there is a lot of work to do. I am also good at self-learning and am a self starter, often try to learn some new software and function on my own, such as KiCAD, PLECS, etc.
